  Performance Assessment:  [+] Good response time for microservices (< 1s)
  [+] Excellent reliability (> 95% success rate)

Test Environment:
  - Spring Boot 3.3.0 microservices
  - Docker containerized deployment
  - H2 in-memory databases per service
  - JWT authentication with token propagation
  - Feign clients for inter-service communication

Memory Optimization Applied:
  - Job throttling with max 25 concurrent jobs
  - ArrayList for better memory management
  - Explicit garbage collection
  - Proper job cleanup and resource management

Comparison Baseline:
  - Compare these results with microservices architecture
  - Expected lower latency due to no network overhead
